# Project Ideas

## NBA Shots Dataset
**Link:** [NBA Shots Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots/code/data)

### Questions:
- Which areas on the court have the highest and lowest field goal percentages for different players?
    - Separate players by position/role, for each position count FG% at the rim(0-5ft distance from rim), floater range
      (5-10ft from the rim), midrange(10-23.75ft), and 3 pointer range(24+ ft from the rim). Compare to FG% of other
      positions, conclusions based on which areas are favored by which positions.
- How does shot selection (midrange vs. 3-point attempts) vary between players or teams over a season?

## Global Earthquake & Tsunami Risk Assessment Dataset
**Link:** [Global Earthquake & Tsunami Risk Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmeduzaki/global-earthquake-tsunami-risk-assessment-dataset)

### Questions:
- Which regions are the most affected by both earthquakes and tsunamis?  
- Can you identify correlations between earthquake magnitude and tsunami severity levels?
